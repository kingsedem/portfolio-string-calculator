If an operator isn't known, an exception should be thrown.

## Running the tests under Maven

The project comes with both Maven and Gradle build scripts. To run the tests with Maven, open a command window and run:

  mvn clean verify

## Use Gradle

For GRADLE, pen a command window and run:

  gradlew test 

## Viewing the reports

Both of the commands provided above will produce a Serenity test report in the `target/site/serenity` directory.
